# Halloweener
Halloween bot 2020

# Commands
(all use prefix defined in config.json, unless defined against)
- randomN - Sends a random Nhentai.
  - sometimes it won't work because there's no official number of dojin on the site, so it'll choose like 999999 and not get anything to send back.
- randomCP - Sends back a random Creepy Pasta video.
  - currently unfinished, as my friend (who I think might want to help me make this bot,) hasn't curated a list of his favs.
- like 30 injokes.
  - By first release they will be removed.
- Dad bot ripoff (prefix: I'm)
  - Have you heard of the Dad bot? I made it in half an hour. (I'm not too good at coding. . .)
- 8ball - send it a question following the h!8ball and it'll give you an answer from an eight-ball.
- rps - Plays Rock-Paper-Scissors. send h!rps then Rock, Paper or Scissors, then send to play. 

# Plans
- spookymusic - will join users vc and play only spooky music.
