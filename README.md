# Halloweener
Halloween bot 2020 (And maybe later on, idk)

Also don't edit the code unless I told you to thanks -Mvb1122
# Commands
(all use prefix defined in config.json, unless noted)
- randomN - Sends a random Nhentai.
  - sometimes it won't work because there's no official number of dojin on the site, so it'll choose like 999999 and not get anything to send back.
- randomCP - Sends back a random Creepy Pasta video.
- Dad bot ripoff (prefix: I'm)
  - Have you heard of the Dad bot? I made it in half an hour. (I'm not too good at coding. . .)
- 8ball - Send it a question following the h!8ball and it'll give you an answer from an eight-ball.
- rps - Plays Rock-Paper-Scissors. h!rps then Rock, Paper or Scissors, then send to play.
- spm - Joins your Voice Channel and plays spooky music.
  - Uses: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EZ517Ls_FE
 - Kitchen Without Gun - Joins your VC and plays Kitchen Without Gun
   - Uses: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O31csGCdCDI&list=RDO31csGCdCDI&start_radio=1
- stop - Leaves your VC.
- getStand - Assigns you a random stand.
- useStand - WIP - In the future will use the move that the stand is known for.

# Plans
- Jojo stand related commands. It would have to randomly grant a stand, then note it in a file and refer to that when the user asks to use it.
  - Preferablly, would interact with the channel. -- Time stop lets only the user send messages (or people with GER being able to do whatever the heck they want.)
  - Needless to say, the server owner'd have to enable it.
 - Comment your own ideas here:
  
   - The World stops time for 9 seconds, letting only the user send messages in the channel.
   - TWOH lets them erase any ammount of messages they want (basically purge a channel if they desire).
   - SP can do the same as TW, but can freeze time for 10 seconds.
   - Six Bullets. Idk what it'd do but it belongs here.
   - GER can speak during timestops and erase 7 messages from the initial command (Would delete the user's message and resend it as the bot's).
   - King Crimson can erase 5 messages, and the people who are in the channel have to chat for 1 second as if it didn't happen, then they can react.
   - Silver Chariot can delete any one message from the minute when the command was sent. (idk what it'd do replace this if you want.)
   - GE turns slow mode on for the channel for 5 or so seconds.)
   - Sticky Fingers pins the next message the user sends.
   - Green Day would let only 10 more messages be sent in the channel before it would be locked down or something.
